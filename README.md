# 🚀 Time Setter Mod for GTA: San Andreas ⏳

## 📝 Description
This mod allows you to change the in-game **time** or **weather** in a smooth and natural way.  
For example, setting the clock from 13:00 to 14:52 will transition minute by minute (a total of 112 minutes), instead of jumping instantly. The concept was inspired by an idea seen in ENB DirectX 3.0, but recreated here in a much lighter form.  

The interface is simple: the current time is shown directly in the chat line, along with a confirmation message once the change is complete.  

The commands are straightforward and easy to remember:  
- `/st` – set time  
- `/sw` – set weather  

Several bugs have been fixed, such as:  
- 24:00 being displayed differently from 00:00  
- Weather IDs above 25 all showing the same effect  
- Other small inconsistencies  

The project is considered final, since I stepped away from GTA San Andreas modding and there was nothing else meaningful left to add.
